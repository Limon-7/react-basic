#### Stateless Functional Component

```
const Navbar = (props) => {
return(
    <span className="badge badge-pill badge-primary">
        {props.totalCounters}
    </span>);
}
export default Navbar;
```

#### Destructing Argument:

```
const Navbar = ({totalCounters}) => {
return(
<span className="badge badge-pill badge-primary">
{totalCounters}
</span>);
}
export default Navbar;

```

#### Object Destructing:

```
render(){
    const { onReset, onDelete } = this.props;
    return(
        <Counter key={counter.id} onIncrement={this.props.onIncrement} onDelete={onDelete} counter={this.props.counter}
        />
    );
}
```

## Life Cycle Hook:

Phase:

-   Mount: The first phases of the life-cycle hook when a instance of a component is created and inserted in the dom. In the mounting phase three life-cycle hooks.
    ..1. constructor: This is called only once when an instance of a class created.If you need to set the state directly in the constructor. Keeep in mind you must pass prop otherwise it will get undifined
    `constructor(props) { super(props); console.log("app-constructor", this.props); }`
    ..2. render: Basically returns a react elements that represnts virtual dom and render it to actual browser dom.**When a component is rendered all its children are rendered recursively**
    ..3. componentDidMount: This method is called after the component render in the dom and it's the perfect place to make ajax call to get data from server.
    **Note**React call this hook by order.
-   Update: this happens when the state or the props of a component get changed.
    ..1. render:
    ..2. componentDidUpdate: This method is called after a component is updated.`if (preProps.counter.value !== this.props.counter.value) { // Ajax call and get new vlue from the server console.log("Ajax call and get new vlue from the server"); }`
-   UnMount: This happens when a component remove from dom.It has one life-cycle hook.
    ..1. componentWillUnmount: This method is called just before a component remove from a dom.**This is the place any kind of cleanup like timer and listener before removing the dom**
