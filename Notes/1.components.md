#### Rasing and handling events

-   raise an event in chaild component
-   handle the event in the parent component

##### Single source truth:

###### remove local state

-   Controlled Component: A controlled component doesn't have local state. It receives all the data vai props and rasies events whenever data need to be changed. So this component entirely controlled by it's parent component.

###### Note: Modifing a state directly in react restricted.

#### Multiple Component in sync
